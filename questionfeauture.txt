Sure, here's an outline of how to create a feature that allows users to post questions and respond to them using MongoDB:
Create a Question model and a Response model with the necessary fields in your application.
 The Question model should have fields for the title, content, author, date posted, and responses.
 The Response model should have fields for the content, author, and date posted.

Create routes for creating a new question and for creating a new response. 
These routes should accept POST requests and handle the form data that is submitted. 
In your route functions, you can create new instances of the Question and Response models
 and save them to the database using the MongoDB driver.

Create a route for displaying a single question and its responses. 
This route should accept a GET request and retrieve the appropriate Question object and all of 
its associated Response objects from the database using the MongoDB driver.

Create a template for displaying a single question and its responses.
 In this template, you can use Jinja2 to display the question and all
  of its associated responses.

Add links to the question and response creation pages in your application's navigation menu or sidebar.

Update your application's home page to display a list of the most recent questions that have been posted, 
along with a link to the page that displays each question and its responses.

With these steps, you should be able to create a feature that allows users to post
 questions and respond to them using MongoDB as the database.
